A fun social game based on fixing the problem of voice recognition not being able to correctly understand proper nouns.
This game solves that problem by silently gathering proper noun pronunciation data under the veil of a fun game so that people don't even realize that they are helping improve speech algorithms.
The collected data can then be taken and used to train better algorithms.
